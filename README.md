# dec2base
A small project showing how to convert a decimal number to an arbitrary base. This can be useful when you want to produce a big number in a compact way to transmit it, say over LoRa, coincidence, right? ;-)

The example converts decimal numbers to base 36, 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ, which makes for very compact strings.
